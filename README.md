/bftools
=======

A personal UI framework using AngularJS.

/goal
=======

The goal for this project is to expand my knowledge and experience in web development by taking what I've learned from other UI frameworks and designing my own functional widgets in AngularJS.

/rules
=======

No cheating! I cannot reference any other existing AngularJS UI library for help. The point is you can't learn the right way to do something unless you do it the wrong way...several hundred times.
